                This is your gun, there are many like it but this one is yours. As you shoot with !bang your gun reliability drops -0.1% per shot. As the gun's reliability
                drops, the odds of the gun jamming will slowly rise. Once the reliability of your gun falls below 60% the gun will stop working until you clean it.

                <br>

                Magazine upgrades (40-60xp) increase the total amount of rounds per mag. Start 7 rounds, max 12 rounds.<br>

                <br>
                In this game there are some settings, or "rules" that can be configured by the botmaster. If you ever receive a message from the bot
                saying "based on current rules, this item is unavailable" or you have certain features that don't work, it is likely because of a rules setting.
                <br><br>
                  <span style="color:#DDDD00"><b>[Gun Confiscation]<br></span></b><br>
                  By default this rule is turned on. If this rule is active, anytime a user types !bang, when there is no duck around, the gun is confiscated and player xp is reduced.
                  Likewise, any kind of ricochet accident that happens during hunting, also results in gun confiscation and xp reduction. If your gun has been confiscated you
                  can buy it back from the shop with !shop 5.<br>
                  <br>
                  If this rule is turned off there will be no gun confiscation, but xp will still be deducted for misses and accidents. Shop item 18: Accident Insurance will be disabled.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="color:#DDDD00"><b>[Bullet Ricochet]<br></span></b><br>
                  By default this rule is turned on to 5%. Botmasters can alter this percentage to raise or lower the occurance of ricochets. If this rule is active, ricochets can happen at
                  the percentage set by the botmaster.<br>
                  <br>
                  Likewise, if this rule is turned off then bullet ricochets will not occur.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="color:#DDDD00"><b>[Searching the Bushes]<br></span></b><br>
                  By default this rule is turned on to 15%. Botmasters can alter this percentage to raise or lower the occurance of objects in the bushes. If this rule is active, finding objects in the bushes
                  will occur at the percentage set by the botmaster.<br>
                  <br>
                  If this rule is not active, searching the bushes for objects will not occur.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="color:#DDDD00"><b>[Infinite Ammo]<br></span></b><br>
                  By default this rule is turned off. If this rule is active, all users have infinite bread loafs and ammo magazines. Players will still have to !reload but will
                  not run out of magazines, likewise players will still have to use !bread to reload bread boxes, but will not run out of loafs.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="color:#DDDD00"><b>[No Shooting]<br></span></b><br>
                  By default this rule is turned off. If this rule is active, players will be able to befriend ducks only. All gun related items and commands are disabled.
                  Players will only be able to use a reduced shop menu and function set containing items for gameplay that involves befriending ducks.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="color:#DDDD00"><b>[No Befriending]<br></span></b><br>
                  By default this rule is turned off. If this rule is active, players will only be able to hunt and shoot ducks. All befriending items and commands are disabled.

                Super DuckHunt is a python IRC Bot game based on the NES Game Duck Hunt. Written by Neo_Nemesis. This script is based on the original <a href="https://www.tclscripts.net/product/duckhunt/">DuckHunt IRC bot written by Menz Agitat</a>. The original game was
                inspired by the NES classic Duck Hunt, and is completely re-written in a new language. This is not a copy or sequel of the original DuckHunt IRC Bot or the NES game, but a tribute to the age of old Nintendo and game consoles.
                experience. <br>
                <br>
                Primarily built and tested on 3 networks, <a href="https://www.esper.net/">EsperNet</a> <a href="https://rizon.net/chat">Rizon</a> and <a href="https://freenode.net/">Freenode</a>. Original Super-DuckHunt versions 1.0+ were built and modified for use on the <a href="https://freenode.net/">Freenode IRC Network</a>.<br>
                <br>
                There is also a version of Super DuckHunt written in <a href="https://www.autoitscript.com/site/">Autoit</a>, also by Neo_Nemesis. It is, as of yet, ultra beta unreleased. Plans to continue on this platform are being considered.<br>

               <p>This is a IRC Bot based off of the original DuckHunt IRC Bot written by
               Menz Agitat. The original game was inspired by the NES classic Duck Hunt.
               This game is also inspired by Duck Hunt, but completely re-written in a
               new language. This is not an exact copy of the original DuckHunt IRC Bot.
               This would be like a sequel, or SNES version of Duck Hunt for IRC.</p>
